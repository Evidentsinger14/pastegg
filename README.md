# paste

*A sensible pastebin.*

## Unfinished: some features do not work

See the issues.

## Idea

Pretty much every pastebin sucks. With Gist removing anonymous pastes, the search for a new pastebin
began, and then it shortly ended. There's not much out there.

There should be a pastebin that's easy-to-use and simple, supporting multiple files, syntax
highlighting, anonymity, and secure authentication.

## Goals

- [ ] API
  - [ ] Sensible
  - [ ] Sane
  - [ ] Simple
  - [ ] Secure
- [ ] Front-end
  - [ ] Pretty
  - [ ] Performant
  - [ ] Functional

## Usage

Clone repo, then do `cargo run`. Use the API.

A folder called `store` will be created wherever `cargo run` is executed in, and pastes will be
stored there.
