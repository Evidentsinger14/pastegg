# paste

*A sensible pastebin.*

## Super unfinished. Like not even close to working

## Idea

Pretty much every pastebin sucks. With Gist removing anonymous pastes, the search for a new pastebin
began, and then it shortly ended. There's not much out there.

There should be a pastebin that's easy-to-use and simple, supporting multiple files, syntax
highlighting, anonymity, and secure authentication.
